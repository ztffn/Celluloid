## üß© Installation

Until the packaged release is published, you can preview the theme by referencing the CSS directly from this repository.

### Option 1 ‚Äî Jellyfin Dashboard (Custom CSS)

1. Go to **Dashboard ‚Üí General ‚Üí Custom CSS**.
2. Paste one of the following snippets at the bottom of the box:

   **Stable build (recommended):**
   ```css
   @import url("https://rawcdn.githack.com/ztffn/Jellyfin-Celluloid-Theme/main/Theme/celluloid.css");
   ```

   **Nightly build (latest changes, may break):**
   ```css
   @import url("https://rawcdn.githack.com/ztffn/Jellyfin-Celluloid-Theme/main/Theme/celluloid-nightly.css");
   ```

   > We use rawcdn.githack.com so the files are served with the correct MIME type. Feel free to self-host or switch to jsDelivr once their cache picks up the repository.

3. Click **Save** and hard-refresh your browser/app (`Ctrl + Shift + R` / `Cmd + Shift + R`).

### Option 2 ‚Äî Host Locally

1. Download `Theme/celluloid.css` and place it somewhere Jellyfin can reach (e.g. `/config/custom/web/celluloid.css`).
2. In **Dashboard ‚Üí General ‚Üí Custom CSS**, point to your local copy:
   ```css
   @import url("/custom/web/celluloid.css");
   ```
3. Save and refresh.

> **Tip:** Keep the import as the last line if you stack multiple community themes‚ÄîCelluloid expects to be loaded after any base adjustments.

### Theme Switching

Celluloid Theme comes with two built-in color themes: **Purple** (default) and **Blue**.

> The stylesheet also listens for Jellyfin's own `data-theme="‚Ä¶"` attribute, so in 10.11+ you can trigger a switch by using Jellyfin's native theme toggles.

#### Method 1: URL Parameter

Add `?theme=blue` or `?theme=purple` to your Jellyfin URL:
```
http://your-jellyfin-server:8096/web/index.html?theme=blue
```

#### Method 2: Custom CSS

Add one of these lines to your Custom CSS in the Jellyfin Dashboard (after the theme import):

```css
/* For Blue Theme */
html { --theme-selection: blue; }

/* For Purple Theme */
html { --theme-selection: purple; }
```

This custom property override is used whenever Jellyfin doesn't set a `data-theme` attribute (older versions, or custom embed views).

For more customization options, see the [customization guide](docs/customization.md).

## üé® Customization

Celluloid Theme is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the theme's appearance by adjusting the CSS variables.

### Color Scheme

To customize the color scheme, add the following to your Custom CSS after importing the theme:

```css
:root {
    /* Change colors to your preference (RGB values) */
    --white: 255, 255, 255;           /* Text and highlights */
    --white-off: 230, 230, 230;       /* Secondary text */
    --jade-green: 0, 200, 100;        /* Success indicators */
    --honey-yellow: 255, 200, 0;      /* Stars and warnings */
    --cherry-red: 220, 50, 50;        /* Error states */
    --deep-blue: 50, 100, 255;        /* Links and focus states */
    
    /* Main accent color - use one of the above or define your own */
    --accent: var(--jade-green);      
}
```

### UI Rounding

To enable custom rounding throughout the UI, add:

```css
:root {
    /* Customize UI element rounding */
    --rounding: 12px;                 /* Default rounding for most elements */
    --rounding-alt: 9px;              /* Alternative rounding for smaller elements */
    --rounding-large: 24px;           /* Larger rounding for prominent elements */
    --rounding-circle: 100px;         /* Full circle rounding for avatar elements */
}
```

### Additional Customizations

For more advanced customizations, check out the `docs/` folder for additional recipes and examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Want to help shape the theme?

1. Clone the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Work out of `Theme/celluloid-nightly.css` (feel free to break auxiliary snippets into `docs/` as needed).
3. Run your changes locally by pointing Jellyfin to your branch copy via `@import url("https://rawcdn.githack.com/<username>/Jellyfin-Celluloid-Theme/<branch>/Theme/celluloid.css");`.
4. Submit a PR with before/after screenshots when possible.

Please keep new CSS tokens documented so we can maintain predictable customizations.

## üêû Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Theme not applying**: Make sure you've added the import as the last line in your Custom CSS and performed a hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R` / `Cmd + Shift + R`).
- **Vertical menu not showing**: The vertical menu is designed to be visible on desktop views. It will automatically hide during video playback.
- **Light leaks not visible**: The animated light leaks are subtle by design and may vary depending on your display settings.

### Browser Compatibility

Celluloid Theme is tested and optimized for:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

If you encounter issues on a specific browser, please report them in the GitHub issues.
